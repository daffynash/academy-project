# Copilot instructions for this repository

This is a minimal React + Vite project scaffold. The goal of these instructions is to help an AI coding assistant be productive quickly by pointing out the project's structure, important files, common workflows, and project-specific conventions.

Note: ο χρήστης προτιμά να επικοινωνούμε στα ελληνικά. Επιτρέπεται η χρήση τεχνικών όρων στα αγγλικά όπου είναι φυσικό.

Quick facts
- Project type: React app using Vite (ESM module project). See `package.json` (scripts: `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `lint`).
- Entry point: `src/main.jsx` mounts `src/App.jsx` into the `#root` element in `index.html`.
- Dev server: `npm run dev` (uses `vite` with HMR via `@vitejs/plugin-react`).
- Linting: `npm run lint` runs `eslint .`.

Architecture & patterns to know
- Single-page React app: UI lives under `src/` with top-level `App.jsx`. Components should be co-located inside `src/`.
- Assets: static images live in `src/assets/`. Note `vite` supports absolute import `/vite.svg` for files in `public/` — `App.jsx` shows both patterns (`import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'` and `import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'`).
- Styling: CSS files are simple imports (`src/index.css`, `src/App.css`). No CSS modules or preprocessors by default.
- Type system: Project is JavaScript (not TypeScript). Dev dependencies include `@types/*` but the project does not use TS files.

Developer workflows
- Start dev server: `npm run dev` — live reload and HMR enabled. Use this for iterative UI work.
- Build production bundle: `npm run build` — outputs to `dist/` per Vite defaults.
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`.
- Linting: `npm run lint` — follow existing ESLint config (`eslint.config.js` at repo root).

Conventions and decision notes (observed)
- Keep components under `src/`. Small utility files can be added under `src/` as needed.
- Use ESM imports and default React 19+ APIs (e.g., `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`).
- For static assets, prefer `src/assets` for module imports and `public/` for absolute `/` imports; follow `App.jsx` examples.
- Tests: There are no test frameworks configured. If adding tests, prefer lightweight tooling (e.g., Vitest) and add scripts to `package.json`.

Integration points & external deps
- React and React DOM (v19). Plugin: `@vitejs/plugin-react` for HMR/Babel.
- ESLint with `@eslint/js` and some React plugins — check `eslint.config.js` for specific rules.

Examples to reference when changing code
- Mounting: `src/main.jsx` — how the app is bootstrapped.
- App UI and asset usage: `src/App.jsx` — shows both relative and absolute asset imports and basic state usage.

What the assistant should *not* change without confirmation
- Replace JS with TypeScript without a project-wide plan (tsconfig, dependency changes).
- Change public asset handling (moving between `public/` and `src/assets/`) without updating imports.
- Modify `eslint.config.js` rules without running `npm run lint` and confirming the linter output.

If you need to run commands locally
- Use the workspace root (where `package.json` lives).
- Typical commands to run in PowerShell:
  - npm install; npm run dev
  - npm run build
  - npm run lint

If any file referenced here is missing or you need project-specific tests or CI wiring, ask the maintainers before adding large infra changes.

If you update this file
- Keep the file concise (20–50 lines). Only include changes that reflect discoverable code and workflows.
