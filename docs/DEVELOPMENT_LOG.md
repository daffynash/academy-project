# 📋 Development Log - Academy Manager

## 🎯 Project Overview
**Academy Manager** - React + Firebase app για διαχείριση αθλητικών ακαδημιών
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase Auth + Firestore
- **Language**: Primarily Greek with planned EN/GR language system

## 👥 User Preferences & Decisions
- **Language**: User prefers Greek language in UI (placeholders, labels, messages)
- **Technology Stack**: Firebase Firestore + JavaScript (not TypeScript)
- **Design**: Blue theme with dark mode support, mobile-first responsive design
- **User Flow**: Flexible system where accounts can be both parent and player accounts

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Authentication System
- **Firebase Auth** for user authentication
- **Enhanced AuthContext** that merges Firebase Auth data with Firestore user documents
- **Protected Routes** using custom ProtectedRoute component
- **User Roles**: coach, parent, admin (planned)

### Database Design
- **Teams Collection**: Uses normalized team names as document IDs
- **Users Collection**: Enhanced with custom fields (name, role, teamIds)
- **Greek Character Support**: Automatic conversion to Latin characters for IDs

### UI/UX Standards
- **Mobile-First**: All components must work on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark theme support with proper contrast ratios
- **Greek Language**: All user-facing text in Greek by default
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) and dark: prefix

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS

#### Player Management System (20% Complete)
**Current Status**: Data model designed, database functions in progress

**Planned Data Structure**:
```javascript
// Player Document in Firestore
{
  id: "player-id", // auto-generated
  name: "Γιάννης Παπαδόπουλος",
  dateOfBirth: "2010-05-15", // for age calculation
  teamIds: ["team-1", "team-2"], // array for multi-team support
  userId: null, // assigned user account (nullable)
  
  // If userId is null (unassigned player):
  parentName: "Μαρία Παπαδοπούλου",
  parentEmail: "maria@example.com",
  
  // Optional fields:
  jersey_number: null, // coach assigns manually
  position: null, // optional position
  
  // Metadata:
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  createdBy: "coach-user-id"
}
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Multi-team Support**: Players can belong to multiple teams via `teamIds[]` array
2. **Flexible User Assignment**: Player can be assigned to user account OR have parent info stored directly
3. **Optional Jersey Numbers**: Null by default, coach assigns manually when needed
4. **Age Calculation**: Store birth date, calculate age dynamically

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Greek Character Normalization
**Function**: `normalizeTeamName()` in `src/services/db.js`

```javascript
// Greek to Latin character mapping for document IDs
const greekToLatin = {
  'α': 'a', 'β': 'b', 'γ': 'g', 'δ': 'd', 'ε': 'e', 'ζ': 'z',
  // ... complete mapping
}

// Example: "ΠΑΟΚ U16" → "paok-u16"
```

### Enhanced Authentication Context
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

- Listens to Firebase Auth state changes
- Fetches additional user data from Firestore `/users/{uid}`
- Merges Firebase user with custom Firestore document
- Provides unified user object to components

### Mobile Optimization Techniques
**File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

```css
/* Prevents iOS bounce scrolling */
overscrollBehavior: 'none'
WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'

/* Ensures content fills viewport properly */
min-h-[calc(100vh-120px)]
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Mobile Scroll Bounce (SOLVED)
**Issue**: iOS Safari scroll bounce when content doesn't fill viewport
**Solution**: Added `overscrollBehavior: 'none'` and proper min-height calculations

### Greek Character Support (SOLVED)
**Issue**: Greek characters not supported in Firestore document IDs
**Solution**: Implemented `normalizeTeamName()` function with Greek-to-Latin mapping
